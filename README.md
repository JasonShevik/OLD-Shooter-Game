# OLD-Shooter-Game
I wrote this around 2010 when I was about 14 years old.  
I wanted to make a First Person Shooter (FPS) game. The code is written in Blitz3D which was the language they were using in a book that I got from the local library about game making. This is not the latest version of the game, but unfortunately I lost the code to that version years ago. I was only able to recover this code because I found it in the records of an old chat service that I used to use.  
I made one other game in Blitz3D even before I made this one that was significantly larger, but unfortunately I don't have the code to that one either.

This version of the game only has a room and half a hallway that the player can move around in, as well as a form of gravity (but no jump).  
The later version that I no longer have included an arm, gun, the ability to fire 1 bullet, a "maze", the hallway had a trap door, and there was another room beneath the one that's already there.
